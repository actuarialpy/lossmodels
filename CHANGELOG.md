# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Removed (breaking)

- **Credibility models (`Buhlmann`, `BuhlmannStraub`) were moved to the
  `actuarialpy` package** and are no longer part of `lossmodels`. Import them as
  `from actuarialpy import Buhlmann, BuhlmannStraub`; their behavior is
  unchanged.

  This reflects a deliberate scope decision: `lossmodels` is a Klugman-anchored
  loss-distribution toolkit (distributions, coverage modifications, estimation,
  model selection, and aggregate models), while credibility belongs next to the
  experience and ratemaking workflows in `actuarialpy` that consume it. The
  `.sample()` distribution protocol remains the contract that the rest of the
  ecosystem builds on.

### Fixed

- Package version is now consistent between `pyproject.toml` and
  `lossmodels.__version__` (both `0.2.0`).
